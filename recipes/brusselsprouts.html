    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><i>"In the year 7, just two months after the birth of action superstar Jean-Claude Van Damme, Belgium was born."</i></p>

    <p>Those were the only details my grandmother told me as she was giving me the recipe for her regionally famous Brussel Sprout Shank'ems. The recipe, passed down for hundreds of thousands of years, consited of only a few ingredients, but the amounts had to be exact down to the Planck. Even the <em>thought</em> of having one extra fraction of a grain of salt accidentally inserted into the recipe is enough to throw the entire process into chaos. As you are reading this and have thus been introduced to the possibility of an incorrect recipe, it is physically impossible to get the recipe 100% unless you forget about this praragraph for at least 3 years. Since this is about absolute perfection, any attempt after this will result in normal brussel sprouts, making this entire webpage useless.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Brussels</li>
        <li>Sprouts</li>
        <li>National pride. But like, not the bad kind.</li>
        <li>An empty mind for reasons discussed earlier.</li>
        <li>A glass of genever</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preperation</h3>
    <p><b><i>Start with cleaning the sprouts and then remove any loose leaves. Trim stems by cutting off the tough ends and halve the larger sprouts. Leave smaller sprouts whole, but cut a cross symbol through the stem. The stem is the toughest part of the sprout and the cross allows them to cook at the same rate as the tender area.</i></b></p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour a glass of genever to your liking</li>
        <li>Drink it as fast as you can</li>
        <li>Put sprouts on a sheet pan</li>
        <li>Drizzle with olive oil</li>
        <li>Add spices and all that jazz, maybe some grated parmesan</li>
        <li>Toss evenly</li>
        <li>Roast at a high temperature until cripy and golden</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And there you have it, The Best Belguim Van Damme Spa de Francorchamps Sprouts You've Ever Had</p>
